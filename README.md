# prompt-game
This originaly was a very basic practice assignment from the Odin Project course. 

Then I started playing with prompts and alerts and thought of it as an extra bit of initial practice and exploration of JavaScript.

After some playing around, it turned into a short prompt game. 

Here I mainly practice Function Declarations, different scopes, and trying to create loops.
